# Cloud Identity Playbook

This playbook is designed to assist federal agencies as they either **start to or expand the use of Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) Services in a cloud operating model**. While each agency should tailor it's Cloud Identity implementation to their agency's current and desired outcome, this playbook **offers guidance and lessons learned** from the Cloud Identity Working Group of the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) Councilâ€™s Identity, Credential, and Access Management Subcommittee (ICAMSC) in collaboration with the General Services Administration (GSA) Data Center and Cloud Optimization Initiative (DCCOI).

This playbook contains both a Cloud Identity 101 Executive Briefing and a journey map to be used by agencies to **identify, plan, and implement cloud-operated ICAM services**.

## Executive Summary
About a page that summarizes the playbook.

### SaaS Bullets from Bala:
SaaS for Cloud Identity:

Most of the agencies may have some sort of Identity and Access Management system already in place. Moving to the cloud there are options for agencies to evaluate.

1. Move the Identity and Access Management system to the cloud and continue with the service that the agency already supports.

2. Agencies can look at the SaaS providers that offer Identity services like Authentication and Federation, Identity Store to take advantage of the capabilities that come with the offerings the vendors provide.
   1. Agencies need to consider if they would like to keep the Identity store within their network boundary whether it is on-prem or in their private cloud.
   2. The other option is they can adapt to the SaaS provider offerings and store the identity in their cloud hosting.

### Key Terms
- **Cloud Identity** - Broad term to define activities that extend on-prem identity services to a cloud provider as well as identity processes in cloud operated services.
- **Cloud Computing** - A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.
- **Cloud Service Model** - A Cloud Service Provider service model that includes Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
- **Identity as a Service** - Industry term for SaaS providers of ICAM services.

### Disclaimer
This playbook was developed by the Cloud Identity Working Group of the Federal Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) Council's ICAMSC in collaboration with the GSA's DCCOI. This playbook is meant to help U.S. Federal Executive Branch agencies understand and plan use of cloud infrastructure as it relates to the [FICAM Architecture Services Framework](https://playbooks.idmanagement.gov/arch/services/). This playbook is not official policy or mandated action and does not provide authoritative information technology terms. This playbook includes best practices to supplement existing federal policies and builds upon [Executive Order 14028](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/05/17/2021-10460/improving-the-nations-cybersecurity) and [Office Management and Budget Memorandum 19-17](https://www.bing.com/search?q=omb+memo+19-17&cvid=d6a3d59cfc214bc383193a26f643e239&aqs=edge.0.69i59j0.1774j0j4&FORM=ANAB01&PC=U531), as well as existing federal identity guidance and playbook. Subject areas with intersecting scope, such as cloud operating models, Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) and enterprise governance, are considered only to the extent that they relate to either operating FICAM services or performing FICAM processes in a cloud operating model.

## Cloud Identity 101 
*(One Page Executive Briefing based on this section)*
- Why cloud identity?
- Cloud operating model comparison
- Links to [DCCOI Cloud Strategy Guide](https://community.max.gov/display/Egov/Agency+IT+Modernization%3A+Educational+Resources+Building+Blocks) on CIO.gov and [Cloud Smart Strategy](https://cloud.cio.gov/strategy/)
- Explanation of how Cloud Identity encompasses extending on-prem identities to cloud identity providers and manages the ICAM process in XaaS
- Graphic that shows cloud management model for ICAM.
- Graphi that shows modern cloud access. traditional vs modern access. basic diagram of vpn to agency and then device to cloud and cloud to cloud communication.
- Primary advantage to cloud services is moving from a capex to opex budget model. Capital Expenses include buying the resources to anticipate demand. More upfront cost in buying equipment and labor cost in configuration and operations. Operational Expense converts to more of a demand model where you pay for infrastructure based on real-time consumption rather than anticipating consumption.
- Monitor activity in real-time and at rest.

## Cloud Identity Journey (Holistic Concepts)
### Use themes/callouts.  
- **Zero Trust Alignment**
- **Challenges aligned with Governance, Risk Management, Vendor Capability, Team/Workforce Capability**
  - *Enforcing identity governance* - Mapping users to roles/lifecycle management
  - *Enforcing least privilege* - Understanding full access of a role within IaaS/PaaS
- **Cloud Myths**
  - *On-prem operating model more secure than cloud (Debunked by Zero Trust)*

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Content
- **Define cloud integration journey**: Exclusively using cloud services may not be the ultimate solution for everything. Most agencies are either all on-prem or extend some identity services to a cloud provider. Journey should start with assumption of all on-prem.
- **Include use of virtual directories**
- **Include multi-cloud considerations**
- **Identify how to consolidate identity services**
- NPE
    - Machine to machine (servers and end user devices)
    - RPA
    - Service accounts

## Journey Steps

### Gain Support  
1. Highlight outcomes in user stories. Explain in simple terms what and how operations will improve.
2. Identify what is success and set metrics based on operational challenges (e.g. length of time to deprovision account, # of orphaned accounts, length of time to reset password, # of roles under management, # of applications integrated, # of identity manual identity processes, # of manual processes automated). Track metrics by operations efficiency (how you're improving) and operational volume (size of transactions). Align this back to federal policy and agency mission objectives. Examples may include
    - Audit and compliance performance
    - Cost savings or diversion
    - Operational improvements (fewer manual tasks, faster review cycles, faster identity processes).
    - Support federal mandate (e.g. Zero Trust, Cloud Smart)
4. **Develop department policy**
5. **Draft a business case including funding consideration**
6. **Define cloud identity strategy and goals**
   1. *Prevent capability sprawl*
   2. 

### Plan Journey
1. **Identify a capability to extend**
   1. *Representative architecture*
   2. *Table of FedRAMP identity vendors*
   3. *Leveraging Single Sign-on (SSO) capabilities* - SSO is usually part of the first step to extend your on-prem ICAM services to a cloud provider.
2. **Security Analysis**
   1. *Enterprise-wide capabilities* - Not all SaaS are "enterprise-ready," meaning they may not support audit logs and modern authentication using OAuth or Open ID Connect.
   2. *Additional web traffic monitoring* - Per TIC, traffic must be monitored and analyzed for malicious activity. This may mean increasing VPN usage for on network monitoring, acquiring a cloud monitoring solution such as a Cloud Access Security Broker or Secure Access Service Edge solution for off-network monitoring, and potentially additional Security Information and Event Management storage for the increased traffic.

### Architecture Considerations  
- Call out DIRA to identity NIST levels.
1. **Identity Management**
   1. *Entitlement Management* - Sometimes referred to as Identity Governance, it can be more complex in IaaS and PaaS than with on-prem. Plan for this and the use of tools which leverage entitlement management protocols such as [System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)](http://www.simplecloud.info/) to sync information between your directory and applications.
   2. *Provisioning and Deprovisioning* - Just because a user is removed from a directory or SSO, that account may still exist in the XaaS. Leverage automated lifecycle management processes that enable lifecycle management simultaneously or a manual workflow integrated with an ITSM to track and audit processes.
   3. *Budgeting Quick Tip* - Most identity products are priced by user, number of authentications, number of integrated applications, or per application connector. Factor this into your budget.
   4. Critical to conduct an on-prem directory clean-up. 
2. **Credential Management**
   1. Use the best authenticator for the use case
4. **Access Management**
   1. *User Access to XaaS* - Users must be able to reach the XaaS. This means creating network paths for users coming from an agency network (direct or through VPN), but also potentially for users not on an agency network. "Use Case - Gmail is accessible off-network but requires SSO which is only accessible on network".
   2. *Protocols* - Access comes in many protocols. Monitor access attempts over all possible protocols such as https and ssh. Also, factor in the use of port translation technology.
   3. *Federation*
   4. Prevent access to personal instances.
   5. RBAC
   6. Admin portals may be secured differenlty for COOP. Break glass admin accounts. Not linked to an individual and uses MFA that is different form other methods.
5. **Governance**
   1. Policies to monitor for configuration changes. Controls to prevent misconfiguration (e.g. default private).
   2. Training admins on existing policies and when policies change.

- Any change to the user experience should come with communication and potentially training.
